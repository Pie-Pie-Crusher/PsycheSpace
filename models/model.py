# models/model.py

# Example: a simple model using scikit-learn or any code you already wrote
# Assume you already trained your model and assigned it to a variable called 'model'

# For demonstration, let's say it's a dummy model
class DummyModel:
    def predict(self, X):
        # just return a dummy happiness score for any input
        return [6.5] * len(X)

model = DummyModel()
